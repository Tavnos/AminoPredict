# AminoPredict (v4)
DNA/RNA translation to peptide:
With resulting analytical overviews,
 Currently as aerobic and anaerobic ATP costs,
 functional side chain group structure,
 monoisotopic mass, and soon the ability,
 to narrow the analytical query to what is needed.
 And some more thorough and illustrated outputs of
 chemical properties with coloured and symbolic aspects.
And,
Peptide codon encodings prioritizing GC, AT,
 max codon distribution, or any as a randomized
 return output, and resulting base percentage.

AminoPredict accepts RNA and DNA characters as inputs,
 and more refinements are still planned.

Enjoy, Tav.
